A simple demonstration of the classic one-second blink program for Arduino boards written in C using AVR-C. This example is written for aan ATmega328p via the Arduino Uno dev board, and as such register names may need to be altered when porting to another AVR chip or dev board. Refer to the datasheet of your AVR processor, and the port layout of any board you may use.
